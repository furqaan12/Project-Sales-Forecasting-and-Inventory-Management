# Project-Sales-Forecasting-and-Inventory-Management
Use Snowflake to analyze historical sales data and forecast future sales, then use those forecasts to optimize inventory levels- 
This project demonstrates how to use Snowflake, a cloud-based data warehousing platform, to analyze historical sales data and forecast future sales. The project includes SQL code for loading the data into Snowflake, analyzing the data to identify trends and growth rates, and using a linear regression model to forecast sales for the next several months. The project also includes a sample Tableau dashboard that displays the sales forecasts and current inventory levels for each product category. This project can be used as a starting point for anyone looking to leverage Snowflake for sales forecasting or other data analysis tasks.

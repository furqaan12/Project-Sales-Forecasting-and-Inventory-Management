# Project-Sales-Forecasting-and-Inventory-Management
 Use Snowflake to analyze historical sales data and forecast future sales, then use those forecasts to optimize inventory levels.
Steps:


1) Use Snowflake's SQL capabilities to analyze the sales data and forecast future sales. You could use a variety of techniques, such as time series forecasting or machine learning models, to predict future sales. 
2) Once you have a forecast for future sales, use that information to optimize inventory levels. For example, you might calculate safety stock levels for each product based on the forecasted demand, or adjust reorder points to ensure that inventory is replenished in a timely manner.
3)Create visualizations using a tool like Tableau to display the results of the sales forecasting and inventory management analysis. You could create a dashboard that shows sales trends over time, displays inventory levels for each product, or tracks the accuracy of the sales forecasts.
4)Use the sales forecasting and inventory management analysis to inform purchasing and production decisions. For example, you might adjust production schedules or order quantities based on the forecasted demand.

# Project-Sales-Forecasting-and-Inventory-Management
This project demonstrates how to use Snowflake, a cloud-based data warehousing platform, to analyze historical sales data and forecast future sales. The project includes SQL code for loading the data into Snowflake, analyzing the data to identify trends and growth rates, and using a linear regression model to forecast sales for the next several months.
